## Commission Structure

### Tiered Commission System

The platform implements a progressive commission structure to incentivize higher earnings:

| Earnings Range    | Commission Rate | Example                            |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 0 - 1,000 GHS     | 20%             | 500 GHS job = 100 GHS commission   |
| 1,000 - 5,000 GHS | 15%             | 2,000 GHS job = 300 GHS commission |
| 5,000+ GHS        | 10%             | 6,000 GHS job = 600 GHS commission |

### Benefits

- **Encourages Growth**: Lower rates for higher earners
- **Fair Pricing**: Reasonable commission for new providers
- **Scalable**: Automatically adjusts based on earnings
- **Configurable**: Admin can modify rates as needed
